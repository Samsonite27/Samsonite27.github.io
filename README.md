This is just a repository that gives a flavour of some of the things I have been working on recently to improve my skills. 

The networks project was a first year project.
The programming for scientists was a series of guided projects in java.
The Poker Project is a work in progress and needs splitting into appropriate classes.
Miscellaneous is just the odd script I actually saved to show some of my interests.
